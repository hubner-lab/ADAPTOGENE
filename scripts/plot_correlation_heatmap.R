# Correlogram of a wide numeric factor table, optionally joined with a second
# block of factors.
#
# Generalized (Phase 3) from the old climate-only signature, which took a
# climate table as arg 1 and positionally cbind()ed the trait columns of a
# metadata table onto it. Two callers now need different combinations:
#
#   Environmental (mode=climate)  A = climate_present_site.tsv, B = NULL
#   Phenotypic    (mode=traits)   A = metadata.tsv,             B = NULL
#   Phenotypic + climate          A = metadata_climate_valid.tsv, B = climate_present_site.tsv
#
# The positional cbind() it replaces was only correct because the climate rule
# was careful to pass the climate-valid metadata subset (same row count AND
# same row order). That invariant lived in a Snakefile comment, not in code.
# Here the two blocks are joined on `sample` whenever both carry it, and a
# row-count mismatch without a shared key is a hard error instead of a silent
# misalignment.

# would disagree with the site-weighted collinearity screen in pregea_rda_setup.R.

# 'site' column, identical rows ARE the sites — climate values are constant within
